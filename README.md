# CS370 - Current/Emerging Trends

<b>Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?</b>

Much of the code was given as starter code for this assignment. This includes the imported modules, the 8x8 matrix used as the maze object, a helper function for visualizing the maze, the actions and action dictionary, the assignment of a value to the exploration factor, the PY files, a completion check function, a simulated game function, a build model function, and the starting code for the pirate.
The code I completed was the Q-Training Algorithm Code Block. This includes initializing the exploration factor, the number of epochs, the max memory, and the data size. I also coded the agent cell selecting free cells and having the maze reset to the above agent position. Furthermore, I programmed when the agent would utilize exploration or exploitation using decision branches as well as storing each episode as an experience. The win history was also programmed in this section as was the retrieval of the training data and the configuration of the win rate. 

<b>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</b>

Computer Scientists collect requirements, refine those requirements, design, develop, test, and maintain the software and hardware that is used to solve problems in multiple industries. They also seek to understand the impact the software will have on an individual, group,and world context.

<b>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?</b>

As a Computer Scientist, I first seek to understand the problem and why it is a problem. I try to collect this information from multiple sources. Then I determine different solutions to the problem. This involves intensive research at a top and low level, which can include flowcharts and pseudocode. I collaborate with my teammates if applicable and start to implement the methods to solve the problem. This can include the use of different coding patterns, algorithms, software and libraries. I then sufficiently test what I have worked on to include regression and unit testing, which can also be used throughout the development of the solution to the problem. I then, if applicable, seek how to keep the solution up to date and perform periodical checks to ensure it is running as intended.

<b>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?</b>

As a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to protect and preserve the privacy of users and the organization. I must also seek to eliminate bias or any misinformation that could be caused by my work. Furthermore, I have a duty to respect different languages, races, and identities during the design, development and maintenance of software and hardware created by myself or my organization.
